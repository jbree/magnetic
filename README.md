# Magnetic
A Safari extension to send magnet links to a Transmission RPC server

## Setup
Needs to be signed with an Apple developer cert to be installed properly. Sorry,
I haven't gone that far yet.

Once installed, go to Safari > Preferences > Extensions > Magnetic, and enter
the URL of your Transmission RPC server. If you're running the Transmission Web
client, it's probably already running and you don't even realize it. It looks
something like: `http://server.local:9091/transmission/rpc`.

Once this is set, Magnetic will detect when you right-click or control-click on
a magnet link, and offer you a menu item to send to your server.
